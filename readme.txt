Build a native mobile app with the contents of your WordPress blog. Fast, easy and free.

== Description ==

Worona is an open source WordPress plugin that enables users to create native mobile apps using their WordPress as a CMS. Worona is divided into 2 different parts: the WordPress plugin itself, which prepares the content of your WordPress site to be sent to the app, and the native app coded using Corona SDK.

From the user point of view, the functioning of Worona is pretty easy (we’ll cover the developer point of view in our <a href="http://docs.worona.org">documentation section</a>). In this first release, Worona plugin takes all the posts from a site, and presents them into an app. To do so, you just have to follow 3 simple steps:

1. Download and install Worona plugin into your WordPress site.
1. Download the app code into your computer, set your site’s URL and app description in the corresponding fields in the code.
1. Build your app using Corona SDK simulator, and upload it to the stores.

All this process is fully covered in our <a href="http://docs.worona.org/worona-installation-guide/">installation guide</a>. We have tried to make it as visual and simple as possible, but we’d love to hear your ideas to improve it!

We believe that Worona will be used as a standard to easily create native apps straight from WordPress. And you are very welcome to join us in this adventure :).

== Installation ==

1. **Install** the plugin from the plugins directory, or **upload** the `worona-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. **Activate** the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once the plugin is installed, visit our <a href="http://docs.worona.org/worona-installation-guide/">installation guide</a> to help you build your app.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? Where is the trick? =

There is no trick. Worona is free and open source. It will always be. We sell additional services like <a href="http://www.worona.org/hosting">quality hosting</a>, <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">uploading your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play or <a href="http://www.worona.org/extensions">premium extensions</a>, but you can always host it in other servers, upload it to the stores yourself and create your own plugins or use the free ones we or other people provide.

= Do I have to compile the app myself? =

If you want to upload your app to the app markets yourself, you have to compile it yourself, but it's an easy task which doesn't need any coding knowledge. You just have to follow some simple steps and we provide you with a comprehensive guide to do so. 
If you want us to <a href="http://www.worona.org/publish">upload your app</a> to the App Store and Google Play for you, we will take care of all the process, so you don't have to worry about compiling :).
